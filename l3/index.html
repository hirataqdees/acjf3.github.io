    <h1>L3: A Specification Language for Instruction Set Architectures</h1>
      <p>L3 is implemented in <a href="http://www.polyml.org">Poly/ML 5.7</a> and the latest version is <a href="l3.tar.bz2">l3.tar.bz2</a> [2018-01-09]. There is also a <a href="l3.pdf">manual</a> and an ITP 2012 paper: <a href="../papers/itp12.pdf">Directions in ISA specification</a>.
      <p>Alexandre Joannou has provided support for Vim syntax highlighting. This is maintained at the repository <a href="https://github.com/gameboo/vim-l3">vim-l3</a>.

    <h2>Models</h2>
      <p>The release contains a sample specification "<a href="tiny.spec">tiny.spec</a>" that is based on Thaker's Tiny 3 computer. For background information see Simon Moore's ECAD <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1112/ECAD+Arch/background/ttc.html">course notes</a>.

      <p>ARM, MIPS and x86 models are available in <a href="isa-models.tar.bz2">isa-models.tar.bz2</a>.
      <ul>
      <li>&mdash; The ARM model covers ARMv4 to ARMv7. It does not cover the Advanced SIMD extensions (Neon) or co-processor instructions. There is partial coverage for floating-point instructions (VFPv3-D32). There is also a separate ARMv8 model that covers AArch64 mode only. It also omits the Advanced SIMD and floating-point instructions.</li>
      <li>&mdash; The MIPS model is near complete for MIPS III (64-bit mode only). It does not cover floating-point and memory management instructions (e.g. TLBR and CACHE). Limited support is provided for some co-processor instructions. A more complete model is available in the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/acjf3/l3mips">l3mips</a>.</li>
      <li>&mdash; The x86 model covers a core selection of x86-64 instructions (64-bit mode only). It does not cover any extensions (x87 FPU, MMX, SSE and so forth).
      <li>&mdash; Prashanth Mundkur has written an L3 specification of the RISC-V architecture. This is available in the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/SRI-CSL/l3riscv">l3riscv</a>.
      </ul>
    <a href="http://hol-theorem-prover.org">HOL4</a> versions of these models can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/tree/master/examples/l3-machine-code">examples directory</a>.
    These models are now <a href="isabelle/index.html">available</a> for use in <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle/HOL</a>.
